OpenGrm NGram - Release 1.2.0

The OpenGrm NGram library is used for making and modifying n-gram
language models encoded as weighted finite-state transducers
(FSTs). It makes use of functionality in the OpenFst library to
create, access and manipulate n-gram models.

REQUIREMENTS:
  This version is known to work under Linux g++ (>= 4.6) and MacOS X
  using XCode 5. Expected to work wherever adequate POSIX (dlopen, ssize_t, 
  basename), c99 (snprintf, strtoll, <stdint.h>), and C__11 (ordered_set>, 
  ordered_map>, <forward_list>) support are available. It assumes you 
  have installed OpenFst (www.openfst.org) 1.4.0 or higher and have 
  configured it with the --enable-far flag.
  	
INSTALLATION:
  Follow the generic GNU build system instructions in ./INSTALL.  We
  recommend configuring with =--enable-static=no= for faster
  compiles. 

  Configuring with --enable-bin=no gives very fast compiles, but
  excludes the command line utilities.

  Compiling with '-Wall -Wno-sign-compare' under g++ should give no
  warnings from this library.

USAGE:
  Assuming you've installed under the default =/usr/local=, the GRM
  binaries are found on /usr/local/bin. Headers will be in
  /usr/local/include/ngram, and libraries in /usr/local/lib.  

  To use in your own programs you will need to include
  <ngram/ngram.h>. Compile with '-I /usr/local/include' and link
  against /usr/local/lib/libfst.so, /usr/local/lib/fst/libfstfar.so
  and /usr/local/lib/libngram.so. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or
  equivalent) to contain /usr/local/lib.

  The linking is, by default, dynamic so that the Fst and Arc type DSO
  extensions can be used correctly if desired.

  See www.opengrm.org for general documentation.
